## Chemical_Parser
A small program that takes a stochiometric equation without educt and product quantities, parses it, balances it, and returns the balanced formula.

Example:
```
solve("C6H12O6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O")

#Solving equation: C6H12O6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
# -> 1*C6H12O6 + 6*O2 -> 6*CO2 + 6*H2O / Atoms on both sides: 6*C; 12*H; 18*O

```
